# Transfer Learning Tutorial

Using Google's mobilenet_v2 image classification model to practice transfer learning.
Main method used here is to remove the last layer (output layer) and freez the initial layers of pretraiend model and appending a new layer as the output layer to tailor it into a specialized classifier.
